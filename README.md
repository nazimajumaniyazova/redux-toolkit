# Todo app based on redux toolkit
State of the app is managed useing **Redux Toolkit**. 
The are two parts in the app: **SimpleTodo** and **AsyncTodo**. 
In the SimpleTodo part, the data is stored in local storage. Users can add, remove and edit todos.   
In the AsyncTodo part, the data is taken from the server. 
The request is sent through a **createAsyncThunk** function. Here also implemented **numeric pagination** and **infinite scroll**.
